Hi there, I'm Yoav Niran.
</p>

<p align="center">
I'm a Senior front-end developer at [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com). For many years I've been working on large-scale web projects. 
These days, I build SPA applications focusing on performance and ease of use. 
</p>

<p align="center">
In addition to writing code, over the last few years, I'm pursuing my goal of becoming a novelist. 
My first novel: White Clouds is now done and I'm working toward self-publishing it. 
I'm currently writing my second book, also sci-fi, unrelated to the first one.
